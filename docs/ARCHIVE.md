## Archived Files

### `agent task list`

**Status:** Historical development plan (Dec 2024)

This document was the original multi-agent development task list used during initial construction of the KAI ERP Connector. It contains detailed phase-by-phase instructions for building the system from scratch.

**Why archived:**
- The system has been built and is now in production
- The document reflects the initial development approach, not the current architecture
- Current development follows the patterns established in `BLUEPRINT.md`

**Current reference:**
- For architecture: See `BLUEPRINT.md`
- For deployment: See `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- For development: See `README.md` and `BLUEPRINT.md`

**Note:** This file is kept for historical reference but should not be used as a guide for current development.
